# Alfa Connectome: ML competition by Wunder Fund

Predict `t0` and `t1`, two indicators of future price movements of instrument
`i0`, from the L11 book-feature representation, trade and additional features.

## Data

Each input has 112 float32 features: two 52-feature book/trade groups
(`i0`, `i1`) and eight additional columns (`a0` through `a7`).
For each instrument, L11 denotes 11 price-like and 11 volume-like features
on each side of the book, bid and ask, plus the separate trade features.
The complete column order is in [Data overview](docs/data_overview.md).

| Dataset | Sequences | Rows |
|---|---:|---:|
| Train | 10,607 | 212,140,000 |
| Validation | 1,873 | 37,460,000 |

Every sequence has 20,000 rows. Steps 0–98 are warm-up; predictions are
required at steps 99–19,999. Process rows in order and reset state between
sequences.

## Metric: Global WP

The metric is **Global Weighted Pearson correlation (WP)**, using weights
`abs(clipped target)`
on rows selected by `need_prediction AND is_scored`. Compute it separately
for each target over all selected rows in the evaluated dataset, then average
the two target scores. On the selected rows, both targets and
predictions are clipped to `[-2.0, 2.0]`, and weights use the clipped targets.
Higher is better.

The validation mask is provided for local scoring. The test mask is hidden.
See [METRIC.md](METRIC.md) for the full scoring reference.

## Files

- `datasets/train.parquet`: labeled training sequences.
- `datasets/valid.parquet`: labeled validation sequences with `is_scored`.
- `datasets/valid_mask.parquet`: the validation mask as a separate table.
- `utils.py`: callback types and input-column definitions.
- `METRIC.md`: scoring specification and reference functions.
- `baseline/`: ready-to-run stateful ONNX baseline (inference only).
- `docs/`: competition website documentation.

## Baseline

The included vanilla GRU baseline scores **0.617052 WP** on the complete
validation set. It runs statefully on CPU with one ONNX Runtime compute thread.

```bash
python baseline/solution.py --validation datasets/valid.parquet
```

The baseline contains only inference code and an ONNX model. A ready-to-upload
archive is provided as `baseline/baseline_submission.zip`; no training code or
training checkpoint is included.

## Submission

Provide `solution.py` with `PredictionModel()` and `predict(data_point)`.
The callback receives the sequence identifier, step, `need_prediction` and
the current 112-feature vector. Return `None` during warm-up and two finite
predictions in `[t0, t1]` order on every required row.

Package the solution and its required model files in one ZIP, with
`solution.py` at the root. See [Quick Start](docs/quick_start.md) and
[Submission guide](docs/submission_guide.md).

## Execution limits

- **CPU:** 1 vCPU; CPU inference only, no GPU.
- **RAM:** 16 GB.
- **Time:** 60 minutes for the entire test set.
- **Submission size:** at most 20 MB for the uploaded ZIP.

The environment is Linux with Python 3.11, local SSD storage and no internet
access.
